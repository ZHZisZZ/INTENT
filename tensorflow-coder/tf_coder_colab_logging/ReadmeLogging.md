This package provides logging utilities for TensorFlow Coder's Colab notebook
interace.

**As a user of TF-Coder, you should not need to install this package yourself.**

In the Colab tool, we would like to log usage data for TF-Coder, so that we can
identify scenarios where TF-Coder can be improved. This usage data will help us
improve TF-Coder for everyone. We also believe that the usage data can form a
dataset that will be a valuable resource to the broader program synthesis
research community.

This data collection is completely optional.
